## Work EXPERIENCE
Research Scientist in Artificial Intelligence (AI) at Sri Balaji University, Pune Inida 
This research focuses on developing a GAN-based artificial intelligence model that automatically converts images into descriptive text. The proposed system combines visual understanding and natural language generation to create accurate and meaningful captions for images. Using a hybrid GAN architecture with attention mechanisms and dual discriminators, the model ensures that the generated text is both realistic and contextually aligned with the image content. Evaluated on benchmark datasets, the system outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality image descriptions. The work has practical applications in areas like assistive technology, content automation, and intelligent surveillance, contributing to advancements in multimodal AI.

### Projects 
1.	Project Title: Predictive Modeling in Healthcare: Multi-Class Classification of Medical Test Results Using ML and DL Techniques  
Description of project :  
The Healthcare Dataset is a synthetic dataset generated to mimic real-world healthcare data. It is designed to help data science, machine learning, and data analysis enthusiasts develop and test their skills in healthcare analytics while avoiding privacy concerns associated with real patient data. The dataset can be used for various tasks, such as classification, prediction, and data visualization, and focuses on solving a Multi-Class Classification Problem where the target is the Test Results column. How to handle healthcare data, including transforming categorical variables (like Gender, Blood Type, Medical Conditions, etc.) into dummy variables for model compatibility. Explored multi-class classification models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to predict test results. Showcased real-time model training and evaluation, tuning hyper parameters for enhanced accuracy 50%. Highlighted the use of confusion matrices, ROC curves, and other metrics to assess model performance in predicting categories like normal, borderline, and critical health statuses.

 2.	Project Title: Multimodal (Text + Image) Architecture for Hate Speech Detection in Social Media using Deep Learning  
Description of Project:   
Researchers and practitioners in fields such as computer vision, natural language processing, audio processing, and sensor data analysis often work with multimodal data to develop algorithms and systems for tasks such as image captioning, sentiment analysis of multimedia content, activity recognition, and more. Multimodal data refers to data that encompasses multiple modes or types of information, such as text, images, audio, video, sensor data, etc. In todayâ€™s digital age, multimodal data is becoming increasingly common due to technological advancements and the proliferation 
of multimedia content on the internet and other platforms. The model's performance was rigorously evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. We also delved into interpreting model predictions, shedding light on the hate speech detection mechanisms across modalities.
